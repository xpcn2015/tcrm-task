/// Events emitted during task execution lifecycle
///
/// `TaskEvent` represents all events that occur during task execution,
/// from process start to completion. These events enable real-time monitoring
/// and event-driven programming patterns.
///
/// # Event Flow
///
/// A typical task execution emits events in this order:
/// 1. `Started` - Process has been spawned
/// 2. `Output` - Output lines from stdout/stderr (ongoing)
/// 3. `Ready` - Ready indicator detected (optional, for long-running processes)
/// 4. `Stopped` - Process has completed, with exit code and reason
/// 5. `Error` - Error related to task execution
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic Event Processing
/// ```rust
/// use tcrm_task::tasks::{config::TaskConfig, tokio::spawn::spawner::TaskSpawner, event::TaskEvent};
/// use tokio::sync::mpsc;
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
///     let config = TaskConfig::new("cmd").args(["/C", "echo", "hello", "world"]);
///     let mut spawner = TaskSpawner::new("demo".to_string(), config);
///     
///     let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(100);
///     spawner.start_direct(tx).await?;
///
///     while let Some(event) = rx.recv().await {
///         match event {
///             TaskEvent::Started { task_name } => {
///                 println!("Task '{}' started", task_name);
///             }
///             TaskEvent::Output { task_name, line, src } => {
///                 println!("Task '{}' output: {}", task_name, line);
///             }
///             TaskEvent::Stopped { task_name, exit_code, reason } => {
///                 println!("Task '{}' stopped with code {:?}", task_name, exit_code);
///                 break;
///             }
///             TaskEvent::Error { task_name, error } => {
///                 eprintln!("Task '{}' error: {}", task_name, error);
///                 break;
///             }
///             _ => {}
///         }
///     }
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Server Ready Detection
/// ```rust
/// use tcrm_task::tasks::{
///     config::{TaskConfig, StreamSource},
///     tokio::spawn::spawner::TaskSpawner,
///     event::TaskEvent

///     let config = TaskConfig::new("cmd")
///         .args(["/C", "echo", "Server listening"])
///         .ready_indicator("Server listening")
///         .ready_indicator_source(StreamSource::Stdout);
///
///     let mut spawner = TaskSpawner::new("server".to_string(), config);
///     let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(100);
///     spawner.start_direct(tx).await?;
///
///     while let Some(event) = rx.recv().await {
///         match event {
///             TaskEvent::Ready { task_name } => {
///                 println!("Server '{}' is ready for requests!", task_name);
///                 // Server is now ready - can start sending requests
///                 break;
///             }
///             TaskEvent::Output { line, .. } => {
///                 println!("Server log: {}", line);
///             }
